# 📝 Simple Responsive To-Do list App

A lightweight and responsive To-Do List application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Users can add tasks, mark them as complete (and uncheck them), and delete the entire list with a single click.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Add Tasks**: Type and add tasks to your list instantly.
- 📌 **Mark as Complete**: Click to toggle task completion.
- 🔄 **Uncheck Tasks**: Revert completed tasks back to pending.
- 🗑️ **Delete All**: Clear the entire list in one go.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across devices.
- 🔔 **Windows Notifications**: Get desktop reminders for pending tasks even when the app is minimized.

## 🔔 Notification Support (Windows)

This app supports **native desktop notifications** on Windows using the browser's Notification API. Once permission is granted, users can receive reminders for pending tasks directly on their desktop.

### How It Works:
- Users click the **"Enable Notifications"** button to grant permission.
- Notifications are triggered based on scheduled reminders or task deadlines.
- Works best in **Chrome** or **Edge** with the app open or installed as a PWA.

> 💡 Make sure to allow notifications when prompted by your browser. Notifications will only work if permission is granted and the app is served over HTTPS or `localhost`.
